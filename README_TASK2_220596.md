The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that describes how data is transmitted over a network. It consists of seven layers, each of which performs a specific function in the communication process. Here are the seven layers of the OSI model, along with some protocols and services commonly associated with each layer:

Physical layer: The physical layer is concerned with the transmission of raw data over a physical medium, such as a cable or wireless signal. Protocols associated with this layer include Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.

Data link layer: The data link layer provides reliable point-to-point transmission of data between devices on a network. This layer also handles error correction and flow control. Protocols associated with this layer include Ethernet, ARP (Address Resolution Protocol), and PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol).

Network layer: The network layer is responsible for routing and forwarding data between networks. This layer also provides logical addressing and congestion control. Protocols associated with this layer include IP (Internet Protocol), ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol), and OSPF (Open Shortest Path First).

Transport layer: The transport layer provides end-to-end delivery of data between applications. This layer ensures that data is delivered reliably, and can also handle segmentation and reassembly of data. Protocols associated with this layer include TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol), and SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol).

Session layer: The session layer establishes, manages, and terminates sessions between applications. This layer also handles synchronization and checkpointing of data. Services associated with this layer include NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System) and RPC (Remote Procedure Call).

Presentation layer: The presentation layer is responsible for data translation and encryption. This layer ensures that data is presented in a format that can be understood by the application layer. Services associated with this layer include JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) and MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group).

Application layer: The application layer is the layer closest to the end user, and provides services that enable user applications to access the network. Protocols and services associated with this layer include HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), and DNS (Domain Name System).
